# Hello Everyone

In this project i try to visualize Djikstra Algorithm. This project boosted by Create React App.

This project already exist in youtube you can check

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg&t=846s

I try to create this path finding project own my on without looking how it's done.

## What you can do after open project ?

You can change the Start Node (Green Node) and Finish Node (Red Node) by drag and drop.
After changing the nodes you can click "Find the shortest path" button to see how Djikstra Algorithm scan the nodes
and find the shortest path.

## Updated

Added Wall Node (Black Node).
By clicking empty node you can add wall node to empty node or while keep pressing mouse and moving
over on nodes you can also add wall nodes. With wall nodes we can block the ways that we want. So we can
change the shortest path with wall nodes.

# Getting Started with Project

## How can you run the project ?

You need to download node.js. Currently i am using version 12.18.4

After downloading node.js in the root first you need to run:

After installing all the packages again in the project directory, you can run:
